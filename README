Sched is a batch process scheduling system allowing for tasks to be
executed asynchronously across multiple cores but allowing for some tasks to be
dependant on others. In this way, processes in the job that rely on other
processes having completed will not be executed until the dependant has
finished.

Sched has been created for my third year project at the University of
Southampton in order to facilitate batch processing a large amount of image data
captured from a microscope without supervision.

For instance, I have a large amount of images that need to be exposure fused,
then once that is complete some of those images need to be focus stacked, then
once that is complete the stacks need to be blended into a panorama. Sched
enables all of this to be executed automatically.

Note that there is no support for processes requiring concurrent access to data.
